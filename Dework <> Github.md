[[Infrastructure]]; [[Dework]]; [[Github]]

Creating issues in GitHub will automatically create tasks in Dework and tasks can be linked to pull requests to automatically update their status.

Dework is an open task management tool used to engage with internal & external contributors.
It is used by contributors to check and apply for tasks.
It is integrated with the [[Github]] repo.

Learn how to set up the integration here -> https://dework.gitbook.io/product-docs/integrations/github
