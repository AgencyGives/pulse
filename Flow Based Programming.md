In [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming "Computer programming"), **flow-based programming** (**FBP**) is a [programming paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm "Programming paradigm") that defines [applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software "Application software") as networks of "black box" [processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computer_science) "Process (computer science)"), which exchange data across predefined connections by [message passing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_passing "Message passing"), where the connections are specified _externally_ to the processes. These black box processes can be reconnected endlessly to form different applications without having to be changed internally. FBP is thus naturally [component-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_componentry "Software componentry").

FBP is a particular form of [dataflow programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming "Dataflow programming") based on bounded buffers, information packets with defined lifetimes, named ports, and separate definition of connections.

Flow-based programming defines applications using the metaphor of a "data factory". It views an application not as a single, sequential process, which starts at a point in time, and then does one thing at a time until it is finished, but as a network of asynchronous processes communicating by means of [streams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_(computing) "Stream (computing)") of structured data chunks, called "information packets" (IPs). In this view, the focus is on the application data and the transformations applied to it to produce the desired outputs. The network is defined externally to the processes, as a list of connections which is interpreted by a piece of software, usually called the "scheduler".

The processes communicate by means of fixed-capacity connections. A connection is attached to a process by means of a [port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_port_(software) "Computer port (software)"), which has a name agreed upon between the process code and the network definition. More than one process can execute the same piece of code. At any point in time, a given IP can only be "owned" by a single process, or be in transit between two processes. [Ports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_port_(software) "Computer port (software)") may either be simple, or array-type, as used e.g. for the input port of the Collate component described below. It is the combination of ports with asynchronous processes that allows many long-running primitive functions of data processing, such as Sort, Merge, Summarize, etc., to be supported in the form of software [black boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box "Black box").
