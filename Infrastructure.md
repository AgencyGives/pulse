Check out the linked pages to see how the integration works and its role in it and how to setup each piece:
1. [[Dework]] - tasks assignment
	- used by contributors to check and apply for tasks
2. [[Github]] - git-versioned storage and editing of repository
	- used by contributors to check and work on files and submit/push changes once it's complete
3. [[Github Desktop]] - sync mechanism between the repo and a local folder
	- used to integrate the repo as a vault on [[Obsidian]]
4. [[Obsidian]] - read/writing platform
	- used by contributors to access and edit (through [[Github Desktop]]) the knowledge base with support to links and the [[Graph view]]
5. [[Obsidian Publish]] - Obsidian publishing platform
	- used by anyone to check the open knowledge base with support to links and the [[Graph view]]
