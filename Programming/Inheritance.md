A [[class]][![Define this term](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/courses/COP402003/define.gif)](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/courses/COP402003/board.html#class)Â inherits structure and properties from a base [[class]]. Some object oriented languages support multiple inheritance. Single inheritance is simpler to implement and avoids possible ambiguity problems caused by multiple inheritance. Therefore, newer languages such as [[Java]] and C# support single inheritance.
