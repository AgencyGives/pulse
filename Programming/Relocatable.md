When machine code is relocatable in memory it means that the code can be moved from one location to another to make room for new or modified routines in memory. Relative addressing is used in the code and/or the absolute addresses in the code are converted before the code is executed. This conversion can take place during the loading of an executable program in memory by a [[loader]][![Define this term](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/courses/COP402003/define.gif)](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/courses/COP402003/board.html#loader).
