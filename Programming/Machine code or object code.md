Machine code (also known as object code) consists of machine-specific operations expressed in binary code. A central processing unit (CPU) of a computer executes the binary machine code which is typically fetched from the main memory of a machine. An executable program consists of object code which contains a sequence of machine instructions. An executable program is loaded (sometimes with a [[loader]][![Define this term](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/courses/COP402003/define.gif)](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/courses/COP402003/board.html#loader) and/or by an operating system (OS)) into main memory for execution.
