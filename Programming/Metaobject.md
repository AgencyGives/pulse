In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), a **metaobject** is an [object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science) "Object (computer science)") that manipulates, creates, describes, or implements objects (including itself). The object that the metaobject pertains to is called the base object. Some information that a metaobject might define includes the base object's [type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system "Type system"), [interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(computer_science) "Interface (computer science)"), [class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_science) "Class (computer science)"), [methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(computer_science) "Method (computer science)"), [attributes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute_(computing) "Attribute (computing)"), [parse tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parse_tree "Parse tree"), etc. Metaobjects are examples of the computer science concept of [reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(computer_programming) "Reflection (computer programming)"), where a system has access (usually at run time) to its own internal structure. Reflection enables a system to essentially rewrite itself on the fly, to alter its own implementation as it executes.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaobject#cite_note-1)
