A preprocessor applies [[macro]] expansion[![Define this term](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/courses/COP402003/define.gif)](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/courses/COP402003/board.html#machinecode) to a source program. In C and C++ for example, #define macros are expanded and header files are incuded in the source for the first phase of [[compiler]] analysis (lexical analysis by the [[scanner]]).
