Prolog is the most polular logic programming language. Most Prolog systems are conforming to the ISO Prolog standard, but deviations make it hard to write Prolog programs that are portable between different Prolog systems. The language is based on formal logic and it can be summarized as an intelligent database system that uses an inferencing process to infer the truth of given queries.
