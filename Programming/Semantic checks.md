[[Dynamic semantic checks]][![Define this term](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/courses/COP402003/define.gif)](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/courses/COP402003/board.html#dynamicsemanticchecks)are performed at run time. A compiler cannot always ensure that certain constraints on programming constructs are met at compile time, for example, whether the index value of an array is out of bounds. A [[compiler]] may generate run time checks in the target code to enforce these constraints at run time.
