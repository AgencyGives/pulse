A lifo (last in first out) structure to hold temporary data. The implementation of a programming language requires at least one stack data structure for subroutine calling (and object oriented method invocation) in languages that support [[recursion]]. The stack holds the return address of the caller of a subroutine and the parameters passed to the subroutine. Local stack-allocated data for the subroutine is also pushed on the stack.
