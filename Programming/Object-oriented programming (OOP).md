Object-oriented programming OOP is a programming style that puts objects and their interactions on the forefront rather than computation as the operation of a processor on a monolithic memory. Each object has an internal state and executable functions to manage that state. This programming style is naturally adopted in object-oriented programming[![Define this term](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/courses/COP402003/define.gif)](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/courses/COP402003/board.html#objectoriented) languages but can also be adopted in procedural[![Define this term](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/courses/COP402003/define.gif)](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/courses/COP402003/board.html#procedural) or functional[![Define this term](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/courses/COP402003/define.gif)](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/courses/COP402003/board.html#functional) languages. In fact, most object oriented languages were designed as an extension of a procedural language (e.g. C++ and object-oriented Pascal dialects) and the concept of a [[class]] is largely based on the concept of an abstract data type[![Define this term](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/courses/COP402003/define.gif)](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/courses/COP402003/board.html#adt).
