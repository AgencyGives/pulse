In [phrase structure grammars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrase_structure_grammar "Phrase structure grammar"), the _phrasal categories_ (e.g. [noun phrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun_phrase "Noun phrase"), [verb phrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verb_phrase "Verb phrase"), [prepositional phrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepositional_phrase "Prepositional phrase"), etc.) are also syntactic categories. [Dependency grammars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_grammar "Dependency grammar"), however, do not acknowledge phrasal categories (at least not in the traditional sense).

**Dependency grammar** (**DG**) is a class of modern [grammatical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar "Grammar") theories that are all based on the dependency relation (as opposed to the _constituency relation_ of [phrase structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrase_structure_grammar "Phrase structure grammar")) and that can be traced back primarily to the work of [Lucien Tesnière](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucien_Tesni%C3%A8re "Lucien Tesnière"). Dependency is the notion that linguistic units, e.g. words, are connected to each other by directed links. The (finite) verb is taken to be the structural center of clause structure. All other syntactic units (words) are either directly or indirectly connected to the verb in terms of the directed links, which are called _dependencies_. Dependency grammar differs from [phrase structure grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrase_structure_grammar "Phrase structure grammar") in that while it can identify phrases it tends to overlook phrasal nodes. A dependency structure is determined by the relation between a word (a [head](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_(linguistics) "Head (linguistics)")) and its dependents. Dependency structures are flatter than phrase structures in part because they lack a [finite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_verb "Finite verb") [verb phrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verb_phrase "Verb phrase") [constituent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constituent_(linguistics) "Constituent (linguistics)"), and they are thus well suited for the analysis of languages with free word order, such as [Czech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_language "Czech language") or [Warlpiri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warlpiri_language "Warlpiri language").
