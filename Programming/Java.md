Java is an object-oriented language based largely on C++, developed at SUN Microsystems. The language is intended for the construction of highly portable, machine-independent programs. Includes (among other things) a reference model of ([[class]]-typed) variables, mix-in [[inheritance]][![Define this term](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/courses/COP402003/define.gif)](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/courses/COP402003/board.html#inheritance), threads, and extensive pre-defined libraries for graphics, communication, etc. Heavily used for transmission of program fragments, called applets, over the Internet. The language is designed to be translated into intermediate Java byte code that can be transmitted over the Internet. Java byte code is executed by the Java [[virtual machine]] (JVM)[![Define this term](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/courses/COP402003/define.gif)](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/courses/COP402003/board.html#virtualmachine)Â or compiled into native machine code by a just-in-time (JIT) compiler[![Define this term](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/courses/COP402003/define.gif)](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/courses/COP402003/board.html#jit). Java is a safe language[![Define this term](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/courses/COP402003/define.gif)](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/courses/COP402003/board.html#safe).
