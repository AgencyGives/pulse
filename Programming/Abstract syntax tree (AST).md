In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), an **abstract syntax tree** (**AST**), or just **syntax tree**, is a [tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure) "Tree (data structure)") representation of the [abstract syntactic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax "Abstract syntax") structure of text (often [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code "Source code")) written in a [formal language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language "Formal language"). Each node of the tree denotes a construct occurring in the text.

The syntax is "abstract" in the sense that it does not represent every detail appearing in the real syntax, but rather just the structural or content-related details. For instance, grouping [parentheses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket#Parentheses "Bracket") are implicit in the tree structure, so these do not have to be represented as separate nodes. Likewise, a syntactic construct like an if-condition-then statement may be denoted by means of a single node with three branches.

This distinguishes abstract syntax trees from concrete syntax trees, traditionally designated [parse trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parse_tree "Parse tree"). Parse trees are typically built by a [parser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser "Parser") during the source code translation and [compiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler "Compiler") process. Once built, additional information is added to the AST by means of subsequent processing, e.g., [contextual analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_analysis_(compilers) "Semantic analysis (compilers)").

Abstract syntax trees are also used in [program analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_analysis "Program analysis") and [program transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_transformation "Program transformation") systems.
