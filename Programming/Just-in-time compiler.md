A translator of intermediate code (e.g. for a [[virtual machine]][![Define this term](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/courses/COP402003/define.gif)](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/courses/COP402003/board.html#virtualmachine)) into machine code for a particular platform. The translation is done just before the program is executed. Just-in-time compilers are available for many types of machines to translate [[Java]] byte code into native machine code.
