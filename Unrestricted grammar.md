> In automata theory, the class of **Unrestricted grammar**s (also called semi-Thue, type-0 or phrase structure grammars) is the most general class of grammars in the Chomsky hierarchy. No restrictions are made on the productions of an unrestricted grammar, other than each of their left-hand sides being non-empty.: 220  This grammar class can generate arbitrary recursively enumerable languages.
