(**Common ground as context-dependent collective acceptance).** There is a collective acceptance of a proposition ϕ in a context c if and only if everyone involved in that context a) accepts ϕ in the context and b) commonly believes that everyone accepts ϕ in the context.

A context can be either a joint activity (for activity-specific common ground) or a group (personal and communal common ground). It is the notions of activity-specific, personal, and communal common ground that demonstrate the importance of acceptance as part of common ground. A definition of common ground as common belief does not permit such notions, because it is not reasonable to assume that one can hold conflicting beliefs at the same time as part of two different contexts. However, it is quite natural to model conflicting acceptances as part of different contexts.

A further observation that we will only touch on in this paper is that the participants in a joint activity draw on some combination of different common grounds: their activity-specific common ground as well as their personal and communal common ground.


# Speculations
There is a network acceptance of a **proposition ϕ** in a context **recursive transform function** **with contextual mapping**, if all agents implied in the **recursive transform function** **with context** beleives that everyone accepts ϕ in the **context**.

I can see the aggregate possibilty of those who have accepted and the spread between the agent's claim and network acceptors.
