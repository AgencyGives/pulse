If you'd like to contribute to the knowledge base check out open tasks and issues to develop the content of a specific topic:
- [[Github]]: check open issues on github and open a pull request for your contribution
- [[Dework]]: use it to see open tasks or check them directly on github

Tasks and issues are opened only for specific topics to be developed. If you'd like to contribute in any other way please do so on the Github repo by opening pull requests and pushing changes to the main branch once complete.
