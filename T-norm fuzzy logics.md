**T-norm fuzzy logics** are a family of [non-classical logics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-classical_logic "Non-classical logic"), informally delimited by having a [semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics "Semantics") that takes the [real](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") unit interval [0, 1] for the system of truth values and functions called [t-norms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-norm "T-norm") for permissible interpretations of [conjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction "Logical conjunction"). They are mainly used in applied [fuzzy logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic "Fuzzy logic") and [fuzzy set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_set "Fuzzy set") as a theoretical basis for approximate reasoning.

T-norm fuzzy logics belong in broader classes of [fuzzy logics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic "Fuzzy logic") and [many-valued logics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-valued_logic "Many-valued logic"). In order to generate a well-behaved [implication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_implication "Logical implication"), the t-norms are usually required to be [left-continuous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-continuous "Left-continuous"); logics of left-continuous t-norms further belong in the class of [substructural logics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substructural_logic "Substructural logic"), among which they are marked with the validity of the _law of prelinearity_, (_A_ → _B_) ∨ (_B_ → _A_). Both [propositional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_logic "Propositional logic") and [first-order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic "First-order logic") (or [higher-order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_logic "Higher-order logic")) t-norm fuzzy logics, as well as their expansions by [modal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_operator "Modal operator") and other operators, are studied. Logics that restrict the t-norm semantics to a subset of the real unit interval (for example, finitely valued [Łukasiewicz logics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%81ukasiewicz_logic "Łukasiewicz logic")) are usually included in the class as well.
