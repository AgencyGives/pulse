instead of staking reputation you stream recognition to a projection (which is the quality projection over time, which is the card) ->

Agency recognizes your recognition vis-a-vis a future as a f(x) of how well you predict etc.
It aggregates derivative recognition vis-a-vis indexes according to the performance of a predictor.

points are simply an embedded realization card...
and it is the first card that is saying that the embedded has been realized...
