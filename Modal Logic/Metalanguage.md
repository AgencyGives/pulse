In [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic") and [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics "Linguistics"), a **metalanguage** is a language used to describe another language, often called the _object language_.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalanguage#cite_note-1) Expressions in a metalanguage are often distinguished from those in the object language by the use of italics, [quotation marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark "Quotation mark"), or writing on a separate line. The structure of sentences and phrases in a metalanguage can be described by a [metasyntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasyntax "Metasyntax").
