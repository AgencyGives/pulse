In this report, we give a computational interpretation of modal logic in which the modalities necessity (A) and possibility (â™¦A) describe locality in a distributed computation. This interpretation is quite natural, given the usual "possible worlds" semantics underlying modal logic. In our case, the worlds we consider are processes in a spatially distributed configuration. Ne-cessity describes a term that is well-typed anywhere and possibility a term that is well-typed somewhere. Thus typing determines the permissible de-gree of mobility for terms, in some cases allowing us to create new processes or move terms between existing processes, and in others forbidding mobil-ity. In addition to the purely logical motivations, we present some examples demonstrating how the calculus of modal logic proof terms can be used to write distributed, concurrent programs while preserving safe access to and manipulation of localized resources.
