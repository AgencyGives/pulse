In [mathematical logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic "Mathematical logic"), an **axiom schema** (plural: **axiom schemata** or **axiom schemas**) generalizes the notion of [axiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom "Axiom").

An axiom schema is a [formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-formed_formula "Well-formed formula") in the [metalanguage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalanguage "Metalanguage") of an [axiomatic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_system "Axiomatic system"), in which one or more [schematic variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schematic_variable "Schematic variable") appear. These variables, which are metalinguistic constructs, stand for any [term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic#Formation_rules "First-order logic") or [subformula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic "First-order logic") of the system, which may or may not be required to satisfy certain conditions. Often, such conditions require that certain variables be [free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_variable "Free variable"), or that certain variables not appear in the subformula or term[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_].

Given that the number of possible subformulas or terms that can be inserted in place of a schematic variable is [countably infinite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countably_infinite "Countably infinite"), an axiom schema stands for a countably infinite set of axioms. This set can usually be [defined recursively](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_definition "Recursive definition"). A theory that can be axiomatized without schemata is said to be **finitely axiomatized**. Theories that can be finitely axiomatized are seen as a bit more metamathematically elegant,[_[vague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vagueness "Wikipedia:Vagueness")_] even if they are less practical for deductive work.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]
