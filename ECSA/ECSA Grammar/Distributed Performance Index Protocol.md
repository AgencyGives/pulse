[[Performance Index (Performance Metric, Performance Count)]] (or [[Network]] index) indexes certain aspects of the [[Performance]] of a [[Network]]/[[Space]]-[[Agent]]">[[Economic Space]] [[Agent]]. [[Performance]] index can be any computed [[Value]] of a [[Network]], anything that can be measured, registered, computed. It turns a series of such INFORMATIONal events ([[Performance]]) into a purely [[Information]] based commodity: anything that can be perceived as [[Value]] be articulated as an [[Economic Event]]. Indices give ECONOMIC AGENTs the capacity to make sense of [[Information]] and guide their behavior. They [[Offer]] a capacity to enact new social priorities; to author futures in cooperation with others; to set incentives and attractors (temporal, indexical measures) for collaborations to occur and make them self-sustaining; It allows ECONOMIC AGENTs to collectively [[Value]] intangibles and other VALUEs, making them collectively sensible, visible & recognized as valuable, putting them into operation, circulation, organizing, regulating & incentivizing social behavior around their [[production]].
