Liquidity is for us messaging capacity: being liquid means being able to message, to link, to issue & receive messages: it tells what kind of a membership/capacity one has in the [[Network]]. What counts as LIQUIDITY and who decides this is one of the key questions defining [[Capitalism]] as a financial system. In [[Capitalism]] LIQUIDITY is governed by the state, the banking system it superintends, and the [[Money]] it endorses. When only those state-approved AGENTs can issue, then a [[Liquidity Premium]] (a rate of return on [[Money]]) can be charged for the risks involved in holding illiquid assets. [[Post-Capitalism]] challenges this hegemony as the source of [[Money]] [[Issuance]], proposing instead p2p reciprocal [[Issuance]] amongst AGENTs in a [[Network]]. Where all AGENTs can issue, there need be no [[Liquidity Premium]]. This doesn’t make LIQUIDITY costless, but it can be backed by [[Stake]] (risking-together) rather than the power of [[Issuance]] and the transference of risk. [[Stake]], or risking-together, becomes the ‘complement’ of LIQUIDITY, giving the notion of ownership a very different meaning from its application in [[Capitalism]].
