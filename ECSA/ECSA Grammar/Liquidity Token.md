[[Liquidity]] [[Token]] is a [[Network Derivative]]. It is the oil that lubricates the [[Netting]] process, by temporarily  ‘standing in’ for different sorts of [[Performance]] commodities or STAKEs in the facilitation of the [[Netting]] process. In other words, [[Liquidity]] [[Token]] is the representation of credit; the mode in which the [[Network]] records credit between one [[Agent]] and another. As credit is general, unlike commodity and [[Stake]] [[TOKENs]] that are specific to particular [[Performance]] commodities and STAKEs, the [[Liquidity]] [[Token]] is the universal [[Token]] in the [[Network]] denominated in the [[Unit of Account]]. It must be redeemed on demand for any [[Token]] on [[Offer]] by an [[Economic Agent]].
