Stake is an ownership of a financial exposure to the contingencies of PERFORMANCEs. It frames contingency as economic potentiality: it is a financial position on a [[Performance]] index. It captures the preparedness to invest in some ownership (a set of RIGHTs) of a [[Performance]] [[Derivative]]. It creates a social relationship, through a set of RIGHTs, different to equity, but definitely invoking the skin in the game aspect. STAKEs are OFFERed to the [[Market]], with no knowledge of which [[Agent]] (prepared to accept the [[Offer]]) will end up the owner, and can circulate in a secondary [[Market]]. Buying STAKE in a [[Performance]] is a way to signal the [[Network]] what you want to make happen.
