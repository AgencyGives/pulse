We’ve realized that we are creating a [[Language]] for new ECONOMIC [[Expression]]. It is an economic [[Language]] that can express capitalist [[Network]] PROTOCOLs, but even more, it can go beyond them. It can encompass capitalist [[Value Calculus]], but express more qualified VALUEs and refuse their collapse into the monological [[Value]]-[[Expression]] that disqualifies non-[[Money]] VALUEs as economic externalities. It is capable of valuing the biosphere, care, intangibles and social [[Innovation]] — without reducing their [[Information]] into one index of [[Price]] and one measuring unit of profitability. It is a post-capitalist [[Language]] (a [[Language]] for post-capitalist ECONOMIC [[Expression]]), in a literal sense. A new [[Economic Grammar]] for the [[Information]] age. The place where this post-capitalist economic [[Network]] [[Language]] is spoken and understood is the new [[Economic Space]]. It is a place of [[Value]] creation where qualified VALUEs — at once in excess of and more granular than that of USD or BTC — can both be expressed, composed and rendered interoperable. It multiplies denominations, which remain interoperable, because they share the same [[Grammar]].
