Economic media describes the convergence of financial, communicative, computational and organizational media. ECSA wants to undertake the redesign of ECONOMIC MEDIA collectively, cooperatively, consciously as a new form of literacy and political engagement. ECONOMIC MEDIA are (1) [[Money]] in all its forms including bullion, currency, credit/[[Debt]], financial instruments, and equity (‘[[Money]]’, financial and synthetic financial instruments and property of all types with their differing degrees of convertibility), and (2) all other media (print, cinema, television, social media, computation). For more than a century these media, ‘financial’ on the one hand and ‘cultural’ on the other, have been convergent. Social media is already ECONOMIC MEDIA: it horizontalized our communication, but left the [[Information]] and [[Protocol]] layer called the [[Economy]] untouched: we can’t control the economic PROTOCOLs that underpin the [[Value]] capture of our communication. And for example “[[Money]]”, “[[Debt]]”, “equity” are already social media, they express a certain kind of social relationality: the social relations [[Capitalism]] has claimed as the meaning of the word “[[Economy]]”. Post-capitalist ECONOMIC MEDIA redesigns this convergence. We want to create a more expressive [[Medium]] to describe our economic NETWORKs, their participants, the nature of their relations and how they change, what they [[Value]], how it is measured and exchanged. A post-capitalist ECONOMIC MEDIA which open and free to use, gives everyone equal capacities of [[Economic Expression]] and does not collapse into single universal [[Value]] definition of a fiat [[Money]] or one “master [[Token]]” (e.g. BTC, ETH etc.) see [[Master Signifier]].
