[[Performance]] index measures one or more dimensions of activity of one or more ECONOMIC AGENTs: it measures its/their economic [[Performance]]. The measurement of a [[Performance]] is a vector: a scalar associated with the specific logic from which it is generated (it’s logical dimension). A [[Performance]] index represents the compression of the [[Information]] of the [[Performance]] unto a numerical index. This compression can take many forms, such as a [[Performance]] event counter, an average, a mean, or even DERIVATIVEs measures, such as speed or acceleration. Specific [[Performance]] index VALUEs may represent economic events themselves, and as such they can be utilized to create new composite PERFORMANCEs and indexes. ECONOMIC SPACEs contain a wealth of [[Information]] that can be utilized to create [[Performance]] indices/metrics. The available data readily includes not only all data about “[[TOKENs]]” and their PERFORMANCEs (supply curves, vestings, sales outside TGEs, STAKEs/state changes of key STAKEholders, valuations), but also all data about [[Network]] organizations  and their PERFORMANCEs (material progress, [[Governance]], STAKEs, realized state changes, AGENTs and their behaviors, what has been accomplished).
