Fundamental [[Value]] refers to the idea that there exists an underlying [[Value]] of outputs which is discrete from [[Price]]. In some versions, FUNDAMENTAL [[Value]] approximates long-term [[Price]] (i.e. ignoring short-term [[Volatility]]); in other versions FUNDAMENTAL [[Value]] is determined by forces other than supply and demand. For Marx, this determinant of output [[Value]] is socially necessary labour time. In the new [[Economic Space]] it is [[Performance]]s.
