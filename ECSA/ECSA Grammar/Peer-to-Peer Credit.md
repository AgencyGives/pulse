Peer-to-peer credit is one of the forms that [[Self-issuance]] may take. [[Token]] [[Issuance]] starts with an [[Offer]] and is realized on acceptance of the [[Offer]]. Users exchange [[TOKENs]] grafted to their ECONOMIC SPACEs in effect issuing each other credit in an act of mutual [[Trust]]. This provides users with [[Liquidity]]. Rather than paying interest for [[Liquidity]] as one does with tradition credit in capitalist sytems, here one OFFERs and recieves [[Trust]] on a [[Peer to Peer]] basis. This economic dyad becomes the basic building block of the social and economic fabric of the ECSA platform.
