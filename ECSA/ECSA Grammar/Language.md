Why do we use a LANGUAGE framing? With it, we can express the capacity of a [[Network]] to define itself as an [[Agent]] and to redefine itself. LANGUAGE framing reveals the [[Protocol]] as a communication agreement: a capability to create new SPACEs and AGENTs through conversation. [[Governance]] not about structures, but about EXPRESSIONs, who can express and what. It also reveals the symmetricity in our approach: if everyone speaks the same LANGUAGE, everyone has the equal capacity of [[Economic Expression]], by which they can start to define ROLEs, make agreements about sub[[Language]]s etc. (vs. the predefined ROLEs of the server-client model)
