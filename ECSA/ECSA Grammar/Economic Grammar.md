Bitcoin identified the TRUSTed intermediary component of [[Capitalism]] – [[Capitalism]] is a regime of verification which depends on faith, which depends on violence and coercion – and saw that there can be more freedom. It thus unleashed the question of the _sociality_of [[Value]] ([[Value]] is always social-institutional), but didn’t give a [[Language]] to express it. Ethereum opened our imagination for possibilities of such [[Language]]. ECSA ECONOMIC [[Grammar]] actually gives us that [[Language]]: with it you can express new [[Value]] forms and the sociality and organizationality of [[Value]] (aka “composite AGENTs”, and “[[Value]] NETWORKs”, “social interaction SPACEs bounded by PROTOCOLs”).
