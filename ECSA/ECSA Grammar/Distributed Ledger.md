A ledger is an accounting record that contains [[TOKENs]] of a specific kind and is associated with a holder. A DISTRIBUTED LEDGER is a [[Network]] of ledgers belonging to different AGENTs, where in one ledger’s entry there is a record of a quantified “obligation”, and in another ledger, there is always a matching entry that records its corresponding a quantified “[[Right]]”.  For example, if the entry represented a [[Debt]] instrument, on one ledger we would have a debit, and on another ledger we would have a credit. The entries on the ledgers connect them forming a [[Network]], where the sum of all RIGHTs and all obligations equal zero, that is, for every entry in one ledger there is a counter-entry of the same kind and the same amount in another.  The ledger presumes that [[TOKENs]] of the same kind are both divisible and additive: they can be infinitely divided into smaller amounts, or added up to a larger amount. The DISTRIBUTED LEDGER is a record that results from the [[Distributed Exchange Protocol]].
