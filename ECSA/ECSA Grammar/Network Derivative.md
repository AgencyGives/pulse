[[Tokens]] and assets are [[Network]] DERIVATIVEs. As a concept, [[Network]] [[Derivative]] expands [[Token]] beyond just a “[[Token]]”, to the metrics that are the underliers of the [[Token]]. If [[Network]] index ([[Performance]] index) is a measure of an aspect of the [[Performance]] of a [[Network]], then the [[Network]] [[Derivative]] represents a position on the index: it expresses a connection to the underlying vitality of each specific and purposeful [[Network]]. [[Network]] [[Derivative]] is a [[Right]] to an underlying – it carries always [[Information]] about the underlying process that creates it. [[Network]] DERIVATIVEs are like a two way interface to massively distributed systems: through [[Network]] DERIVATIVEs you can both sense into them and affect them. [[Network]] indices and [[Network]] DERIVATIVEs build from this [[Information]] will be the primary content discovery paradigm of the Economic Web where nodes are [[Space]]-[[Agent]]">[[Economic Space]] Agents and [[TOKENs]] the links in the [[Network]] – just like keyword based search was the dominant content discovery paradigm in Web 1.0 (where nodes were documents and hyperlinks the links in the [[Network]]) and social based feed was for Web 2.0. (where nodes were people, brands and likes/follows the linking mechanism).
