Issuance means the creation of new [[Money]], securities (stocks, bonds, notes, debentures, bills, DERIVATIVEs) or [[TOKENs]]. In the legacy financial system, ISSUANCE is undertaken by banks in the case of [[Money]], and other legal entities in the case of securities (corporations, TRUSTs, governments). The [[Distributed Exchange Protocol]] says that any [[Economic Agent]] can be an issuer, so long as the [[Network]] TRUSTs the ISSUANCE.
