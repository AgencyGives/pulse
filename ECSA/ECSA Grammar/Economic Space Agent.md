[[Economic Space]] [[Agent]] has the same capacities as an [[Economic Agent]], but follows a set of PROTOCOLs that enable it to create relational [[Value]] forms, [[Liquidity]], and risk-sharing through commodity ([[Performance]]) [[TOKENs]], [[Liquidity]] [[TOKENs]] and [[Stake]] [[TOKENs]]. Via a distributed payments and settlement [[Protocol]], they can issue and clear credit among each other by issuing [[Liquidity]] [[TOKENs]], denominated in a shared [[Unit of Account]] with a parity exchange agreement. Via a distributed risk sharing [[Protocol]], AGENTs can issue [[Stake]] in the output ([[Performance]]) of an [[Space]]-[[Agent]]">[[Economic Space]] [[Agent]]; it serves as a [[Collateral]] for [[Liquidity]] [[TOKENs]] and determines the size of the reciprocal credit line. Together these PROTOCOLs make a formal [[Economic Grammar]]: a new economic [[Language]] for expressing economic-organizational relations.
