A [[Protocol]] for [[Space]]-[[Agent]]">[[Economic Space]] Agents to create [[Stakeholding]] relationships in each others’ [[Value]] productions and to COLLATERALize credit lines. By issuing and OFFERing/accepting [[Stake]] [[TOKENs]] [[Space]]-[[Agent]]">[[Economic Space]] Agents gain capability to enter the P2P [[Stakeholding]] [[Network]]. OFFERs of [[Stake]] [[TOKENs]] are accepted, creating a [[Stakeholding]] relationship, and a transfer of a specific ownership. [[Stake]] serves as [[Collateral]] for credit. The [[Stakeholding]] [[Network]] is like a subNETWORK created through the [[Stake]] [[TOKENs]]: how a [[Stake]] [[Token]] relates to another [[Stake]] [[Token]] (the logic) is inside [[Stake]] [[TOKENs]]. Putting on [[Offer]] a [[Stake]] [[Token]] introduces the capacity to create another [[Network]][[Stake| (a S]]TAKE holding [[Network]]) into the DEX [[Protocol]]. The capacity of P2P [[Issuance]] of [[Stake]] enables AGENTs to diversify (share) risks: to risk-together. Capacity to issue [[Stake]] into a [[Value]] production opens up new fundraising forms.  Gives ECONOMIC AGENTs a capacity to create recognised [[Collateral]] for credit [[Issuance]]. In short, gives ECONOMIC AGENTs a capacity for wealth creation and accumulation around heterogeneous [[Value]] productions. Allows new forms of sharing risk & upside (new kind of relations) directly among peers, and allows [[Space]]-[[Agent]]">[[Economic Space]] Agents to design these forms; you can organize/STAKEhold around VALUEs and NETWORKs that you [[Value]]. A key piece in the [[Space]]-[[Protocol]]">[[Economic Space Protocol]] (ECSP).
