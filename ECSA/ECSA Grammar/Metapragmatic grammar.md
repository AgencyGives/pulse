Metapragmatic [[Grammar]] is the multi-[[Agent]], real-time design and play ([[Expression]]) of [[Performance]] scripts (aka SOCIAL DERIVATIVEs), participation in them and sharing in their outcomes. The metapragmatic nature of the ECSA economic-organizational [[Grammar]] allows multiple players to script PERFORMANCEs (productive organizations) like interoperating narratives, with the kind of nuance, immediacy and reflective multi-[[Agency]] native to narratives.

Metapragmatic [[Grammar]] OFFERs a more fundamental understanding of the communication situation VS. the contract model and the efficient [[Market]] model.

METAPRAGMATIC [[Grammar]] redefines distributed system as a whole defined by the changing relationship of its parts, which does partitioning by indexing and does not have to choose between consistency and fork.
