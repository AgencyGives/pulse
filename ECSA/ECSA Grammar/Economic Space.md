**We think we are discovering a new [[Value]] form: a new social and relational form that characterizes the [[Information]] age, and the old [[Economic Grammar]] does not express or understand. We call it the ECONOMIC [[Space]]. 

(1) ECONOMIC [[Space]] is an economic collaboration [[Space]] bounded by a [[Protocol]].

(2) ECONOMIC [[Space]] is an [[Expression]], but can also become an expressor, i.e, an [[Agent]] or [[Agency]]. Why is it important to see an economic interaction [[Space]] bounded by a [[Protocol]] also as a synthetic [[Agent]] rather than just a [[Market]]? This reflectivity means that a [[Network]] can fold on itself, it can express itself as a living thing: that it can create its own subjectivity, talk and reason about itself and create its own (ECONOMIC [[Space]]) [[Agency]].  It means it can have an ethic, a relation to itself, to affect and be affected by itself.  We are moving from a mere endless “multitude” (Deleuze) to “severality” (Bracha Ettinger) or to a “fold”.

(3) ECONOMIC [[Space]] is an [[Agent]] that is able to hold, issue, clear, credit, [[Stake]] and trade. It is like a hybrid of a wallet, a ledger, a trader, a dealer, a STAKEholder, an organizer, a [[Market]] maker, a curator, a navigator. An ECONOMIC [[Space]] has its own ledger(s) and is able to send, receive and engage in financial relationships: to create relationships with other ECONOMIC SPACEs. [[Network]] of OFFERs enables the creation of persistent patterns (“organization”) in these relations.

(4) ECONOMIC [[Space]] is also known as a [[Social Derivative]].**
