Price is a [[Derivative]] index on underlying [[Information]] that reduces complex [[Information]] into something simple. It is just one way to index [[Information]], and though it gets treated as the privileged index of valuation in [[Capitalism]], it is just a political and social construct, i.e., an [[Expression]]. We can design many different kinds of indices to help us navigate. PRICE does not capture [[Innovation]] very well. It runs only on one note. What if we could have a symphony?
