This is an invitation to understand our economy as a redesignable communication medium and organization system, where our exchanges are not only material but also informatic. It is an invitation to enter a practical conversation on the reconfiguration of the system we rely upon to collectively organize, govern and empower each other to transform our world. 

It is about the importance of identifying and recognizing the formal dimension of our economy as a multilayer communications network. A network whose protocols we can elucidate, and thus, reflect upon, redesign, and redeploy. Critically, besides the responsibility for many of our most pressing challenges, these protocols also contain the potential to successfully overcome them on a planetary scale.

To serve our intent, we must formalize our network's functional building blocks; we must outline its forms, the interplay of such forms, and the totality of what they create. To do so, we must frame our economy as a collective "conversation" about what we can "do", which has a "language": A set of conventions dictating how to "speak" and what we can "say".  

This economic language contains familiar terms like account, asset, liability, netting, and exchange rate. These terms refer to each other through formal definitions assembling an "economic dictionary". Moreover, it follows a "grammar", a set of rules that dictate how we may put these terms together: an economic protocol, as we shall discover.

This language contains terms that imply roles that equip us with various expressive capacities and arrange us in different relationships. They determine in which capacity we get to participate in our economic network: which words we can use, whom we can communicate with, and what we can do together.

Despite having evolved organically and without a central designer, the grammar and dictionary of this language are surprisingly well formalized. It's an amalgamation of different systems and practices, organized coherently in no small measure due to the formal nature of counting and arithmetic. Yet, despite all its shortcomings, it is easy to appreciate its development as one of humanity's most amazing organizational artifacts.

In many ways, our primitive economic networks constituted a rudimentary distributed computational medium: A network of bookkeepers and their ledgers bound through their accounting practices, whether recorded on stone, tablet, or paper. Although these networks predate our current digital infrastructure by millennia, we could argue that in great measure, they have given rise to it and, in fact, are its ancestors. It is not surprising that we see their digital expression almost as second nature.

Computational networks are the new medium of our economic networks, hosting the record-keeping and the calculation historically undertaken by their previous forms. We have rendered the updates on our ledgers, our transactions, incredibly fast and incredibly vast.

And despite the emerging array of financial instruments and the rise of "crypto", our economic language and many of its base premises and terms remain effectively unaltered.

What counts as value, money, collateral, or gain? Who gets to issue? And why? Unfortunately, outdated assumptions in the economic terms that answer those questions and others remain ingrained in many of our "new" protocols. 

But how come? With no real manager present in a many-to-many communications network, changing these terms and presumptions is particularly challenging. Moreover, they are depended on by higher layers of our current economic networking stack, effectively fixing them in place. 

Like with any language, new terms need to reach a critical mass of adoption, to gain not only meaning but importance. A network is only as valuable as the number of its participants. Their utility is proportional to the number of accounting systems that implement them. Fortunately, it is a challenge that we can overcome.

Albeit obscured by the complexity of our legacy systems and the opaqueness of their interfaces, our economic language is still simply the result of a historical stacking of artifacts and practices. Many of them have served us greatly, although not necessarily equally. Yet, we can see the adverse effects over large temporal and social scales on many others.

Most of us can sense an acute need for a different economic system. But let's not dispose of the broom with the dirt. While our economic terms and relationships may seem solidified by the momentum of our past convention and practice, we can reassemble them to gain new capacities and regain those we have lost.

To successfully update our economic system, we need to reveal its language and elucidate the protocols that uphold it. Once opened, we may bring it to light as an assemblage of communication and coordination artifacts that we can consciously reconfigure, reimplement, and with which we can experiment. 

We must also recognize our economic system as a mass communication medium, where the quality, nature, and distribution of what we "produce" rely on what we can coordinate with it. This, in turn, depends on what we can convey through it and the capacity in which we invite each other to join in.

To better understand our economic system's formal communication and organizational dimension, let's go to its heart: Accounting.

Accounting is a collaborative record-keeping and calculation system based on simple arithmetic.

We use accounting to organize and record our transactions in a ledger or a book of accounts. The records in the ledger contain valuable information that is essential to "carry out business". Accounting organizes our economic interactions so we may derive timely, attestable, and practical information. Regardless of our "business" or the differences in our practices, we bind them together when we record a transaction.

Through accounting, we record every transaction in at least two ledgers. To reflect what I transfer to you, you make a positive entry in your ledger: a credit; I make a negative one of matching amount in mine: a debit. To reflect the transfer going the other way around, I make a positive entry in my ledger, and you make a negative one in yours. We distribute our transaction record across two mutually referring ledgers. Together with our accounting practice, we create a fundamentally networked, non-hierarchical, and distributed record-keeping system: A distributed ledger.

Accounting practices contain rules and procedures that determine how we classify and record information, how we can change it, verify it, and compile and communicate it. If our economic language has a dictionary, it must have a grammar: Accounting.

Furthermore, through accounting notions like assets and liabilities, we agree to connect not only instantaneously but across time. They represent a formal agreement where your right, an asset, is my promise and future obligation, a liability. Accounting not only serves us by organizing our pasts but our futures too.

The matching credits and debits we record indicate the transfer of anything and how much of it: They describe a value flow between us. Every transaction we make records our operations and necessarily connects our ledgers. As we understand the accounting information network binding and coordinating our activities and of those we transact with, we can appreciate accounting not only as a record-keeping and calculation system but, more significantly, as a communication and organization system. 

Accounting is a formal record-keeping, communication, and calculation agreement between two or more parties: A network computation agreement, which is precisely the definition of a network protocol. 

Simply put, accounting is a peer-to-peer protocol. And It may be our earliest one.

Not surprisingly, and even though in great measure it can be, and in fact is, delegated, automated, and mediated through a banknote, a check, a credit card, or an app, it is still implicitly operating.

The primary accounting practice outlined above does not dictate what we enter into the ledger, only how we must enter it. It does not determine the amount we record, only that we record an amount. The practical agreements we make through trade determine the content of the transactions we register. A transaction encodes a simultaneous and reciprocal transfer of objects of value; it is the result of a fundamental operation term in our economic language: exchange.

Accounting facilitated trade is a protocol where accounting serves the function of storage, retrieval, and integrity verification of information. Trade is the user interface through which we agree to interconnect and create that information. Through our transactions, we determine how we progressively update our network state.

In summary, trade and accounting form our core economic protocol and language. This implicit and omnipresent agreement binds together our current economic network.

But why do we use this language? What does our network protocol communicate? And what purpose does it serve?

We record in the ledger our tacit response to an essential economic question: "what is valuable?".

The transactions on the ledgers that document our exchange reflect a de facto practical agreement on what we value of each other. 

Additionally, the amounts we record respond to another question: "How valuable is it?".

We embed a measurement in the ledger entries of our transactions: an exchange rate. This ratio reflects the "value" we give to one thing in terms of another.

These protocols orchestrate a value communication network. Together with the transfer of the "real" objects of value that the ledger records, the protocols constitute a networked value organization and distribution system. 

The offers preceding our transactions are acts of communication. Through offers and within a network, we are in a constant dialogue of what we deem valuable. Then, we agree on how valuable it is by counter-offering or accepting them.

Our offers convey both question and answer to "What do we want or need?" and "What can we do?". Our offers imply both objective and subjective criteria of what is feasible, desired, or necessary. What we offer expresses what we deem possible. What we transact determines what becomes real. Thus offer by offer, and transaction by transaction, first we communicate, and second, we reorganize the state of the world in a continuous feedback loop.

Accounting and trade form a coordination agreement that helps us communicate, create, and distribute the things we value. It is a network organization system that helps us arrange our things and how we must interact to do so. It is also essentially simple: We negotiate our agreements by exchanging assets and liabilities. Transaction records create a shared memory to evaluate past and future decisions. Assets and liabilities describe the activities we must perform.

Accounting and trade constitute our layer one economic interoperability protocol. 

Remarkably, unlike other systems, this organizational system does not require membership approval protocols or central decision-making bodies. It is inherently permissionless and non-hierarchical. Consequently, it is not only freely adopted but also easily scaled. 

Suffice it to say that this protocol and its language comprise a potent and widely deployed organizational device.

Notice that there is no mention of terms like money, credit, or price up to this point. We intentionally start by describing the protocol that forms the first layer of our economic networking stack. From a multilayer protocol perspective, terms like these are "second-order" constructs: higher protocol layers built on top of another. When we start from the core outlined above, and by agreeing to label and differentiate additional accounting and exchange practices, we can introduce new terms that expand our base economic protocol and language.

For example, let's take up "what counts as money?". We must inscribe a choice in our ledgers regardless of which asset we choose, credit or coin. By adopting this choice as our accounting convention, we create a new account type with the notion of "unit of account".

We encode our new agreement as a trade-accounting system. We must also expand our language to signify the mediation of all our exchanges through a single asset type. We call one direction of the transaction, payment, one of the offers, sale, and one of the exchange rates, price. We classify traders as sellers or buyers depending on which side of the transaction we take. We also answer the question of "What value do we all share?". It is a simple accounting agreement encoding significantly different economic practices, terms, and relationships: an expanded accounting protocol that invokes a distinct economic network. 

By including "money" in our language, we implicitly agree to a new accounting and exchange practice. In other words, we adopt a second-order accounting protocol. From our protocol perspective, money is but a ledger artifact with a distinct label. The ledger inscription and description process, which we share in our network, makes our money economically "real". More than a thing, our money is an accounting agreement.

In the same fashion, if we wish credit to be money, we must add another layer to our accounting protocol. We must introduce accounting terms like debt, clearing, principal, interest, and collateral. Thus, we extend our economic language, and through a new asset class, we give rise to an even higher-order protocol. Interestingly, anyone who utilizes this language (even unwittingly) is de facto entering into an accounting agreement and the network we create with it. 

Whose ledgers we agree to debit our "money" credits corresponds to: "who do we empower and trust with the privilege to issue them?".

To go on and answer the question of "What counts as collateral?" we must bring in terms like borrower, lien, or equity. These accounting terms further extend our economic language and protocols: they further specify an economic networking agreement. 

Furthermore, to answer the question of "What do we seek together?", or in other words, "Why?", we must adopt measurements that signify "gain" and "growth". To guide and focus the economic objectives of our network, we must introduce new accounting terms and practices that compile our transaction records and calculate their values. By choosing to privilege money as the means, we introduce terms like realized and unrealized profit and loss, capital, and net worth. 

Building on the base of accounting and trade, layer by layer, we can continue to the point we rebuild all of modern finance; and reveal all its instruments, metrics, practices, and the answers they give to our economic questions as economic terms and higher-order protocols. 

Or we can build a different economic networking stack. 

Although finance is at the intersection of accounting, trade, and contract law, it is an adaptable protocol layer. It is a moving piece, or rather a highly versatile language to create pieces: asset-liabilities devised to fit on top of other base accounting protocols. Therefore, we may seamlessly utilize financial devices along with alternative settlement instruments or operations, and different notions and measurements of gain or growth.

To enter into new economic agreements, we must utilize new language and higher-order accounting, exchange, and financial protocols that encode new asset types and accounting operations. These may be as simple as virtual coins or as complex as novel financial instruments. As a result, we may respond differently to "what can we say?" and perhaps more importantly, "whom can we speak with?"

Crucially, to shift or reshape our collective economic activity, we must define different performance metrics and share alternative accounting measurement calculations, giving a different collective response to "what outcomes do we value and seek together?".

The instruments we issue describe and enable what we produce. Exchange determines how we distribute it. Whom we accept them from determines whom we empower or disempower with their capacities. How we value, or measure them, determines the choices we encourage each other to make.

The act of issuance can only occur through an exchange offer. I can issue a liability only if you recognize and accept it as an asset. If who can issue these instruments corresponds to "who can speak?", then whom we accept them from represents, "Who are we listening to?". What we issue also contains the answer to "What are we doing together?". Accordingly, how we account them answers "Why?".

Since assets are transferable, we must understand that their issuers enter into an agreement with everyone who holds them and anyone who may do so in the future. Therefore, the network is who broadly listens; the issuer must respond to; and evaluates their offers.

When we exchange, we communicate; when we create new asset types, we articulate new meanings. We can literally, although virtually, coin new economic words. When we increase our capacity to issue, we increase our economic expressivity. When we share what and how we value, we share a direction to coordinate our activities. Thus, we gain different organizational functions and objectives and new productive and creative capacities. 

Beyond assets or liabilities, the instruments we issue are our economic-communication interfaces: they determine how others can connect, relate and interact with us. They are economic networking agreements containing the terms that describe how we may interact.

Furthermore, to inform and empower our choices, we must specify and account for the intent or motivation we enter into those agreements and determine the instruments and accounting information we use and derive from them to classify, measure, and compare them. And support our collectively desired outcomes.

This is how we expand our economic language and empower ourselves and others to speak it. It is also how we expand, enhance or transform what we do with it.

Though we can argue that we have come to create our accounting protocols through our "external" social realities, conventions, and practices, it is also true that our accounting protocols maintain and reify them. Moreover, as computers have taken on hosting, administering, and mediating our protocols, we have gained a fantastic leverage point to update them: by progressively, and perhaps urgently, designing and adopting new economic terms, metrics, and interfaces.

What we can coordinate through them is no longer bound by the limits of paper or institutional agents. With computer networks as a medium, our instruments and metrics may contain elaborate programs, information, and communication logic. We can only speculate on what, previously impossible, collective endeavors we may accomplish when wholly given access to this means of organization, or the extent, power, and nature of the economic networks that we can form.

With this capacity, we must uncover and question the outdated presumptions and prejudices that we unnecessarily hold on to in the economic measures and the terms attached to our financial instruments, inclusive of "assets" and "liabilities". Like all languages, our economic language not only describes but inscribes our environment. Our socio-economic reality is the direct result of its use. Therefore, we must use a different language and protocols to record and program a different world. We must redefine, change or add new terms to re-inscribe our economic relationships and their outcomes.

This framing strengthens the formal dimension of economics to assist in the birth of "economic protocol design" as a widely available discipline. It empowers us to collectively find better and more reliable answers to our economic questions. And challenges. With it, we may both code and simulate alternate economic systems to test, improve and iterate rather than debate endlessly, or worse, fight for their hypothetical merits and flaws.

This framing also gives us a more fertile and much more tractable conversation platform where we can invite more of us to participate. And it is an ongoing conversation that already has tangible momentum towards more inclusivity. 

Fortunately, thanks to computation and new protocols, our economic networks are becoming increasingly expressive and accessible: shifting gradually from predominantly hierarchical architectures to largely non-hierarchical ones. However, the pull in the opposite direction is also strong.

Why model our economic system as a multilayer network protocol and language? 

Because such encoding precedes its implementation as a shared distributed network protocol running on our public computer networks, necessarily opening both its source code and its access.

As we progress in recoding our economic language into computing protocols, so does their distributed nature, expressiveness, and accessibility. Moreover, we can trace this impulse along with the discourse of "decentralization" back to the appearance of the first viable alternative economic means of communication: the Internet.

As we realize that the basic architecture of our economic protocols is fundamentally non-hierarchical and distributed, we can identify and point out arbitrarily centralized layers and redistribute their functions. Of course, we may keep some of the hierarchy or centrality of higher-order protocols and their enabling structures. Perhaps to reduce complexity and operation costs or maintain resiliency and interoperability. But even those protocol design choices are now only optional.

By recognizing, implementing, and adopting standard computational accounting protocols and building layers on top of them rather than from scratch, we can make them inherently interoperable, opening them to widespread experimentation. Moreover, we can easily upgrade them by making them programmable through user-defined instruments and metrics.

We can empower everyone to access the same economic capacities to balance economic power asymmetries and upgrade our wallets, accounts, cards, and apps with new and different capabilities. 

Critically, by empowering not only institutions but everyone to issue readily and reliably, we unlock new, more creative, and more robust economic networks. We can reencode our dialogue, empower our actions, and assemble our efforts by using the language and devices with which transformation undeniably happens at scale.

Above all, we can define and measure our gain or growth using different benchmarks and create new networks that literally account for values different than, although perhaps along with, monetary profit. As a result, we can coordinate and incentivize our activities around them and reward different and much-needed social and ecological outcomes.

To achieve this, we must make our protocols open, reliable, and transparent. By making them readily accessible, we can cause an exponential increase in their adoption, thus accelerating the upgrade of our economic system, and finally, gain the agency that we sense and tell ourselves it should afford us.  

The promise of this invitation is not only to expand the reach and power of existing economic networks. It is to fully utilize the capacities of our computer networks, not to replicate and rehost current economic interfaces, but to redefine and redistribute our access to them.

Starting with where we are and recognizing the code and power of accounting, trade, and finance, we can experiment with new economic protocols while remaining interoperable with our legacy networks. By reevaluating and reencoding our economic terms and operations, we warrant our evolution towards a sustainable, equitable, and empowering economic system. Where it is expressivity, and most importantly, inclusivity, that drives, governs, and designs its capacities.

Our economy, its language, and protocols form a reconfigurable and expandable value transmission and coordination system: a network operating system. By making its source code accessible, we can reprogram it.

The most important question that we need to respond to now is, given this opportunity, what kind of upgrades are we installing?
