[[Infrastructure]]

If you'd like to use [[Obsidian]] to view and edit notes from the knowledge base - with support to links and the [[Graph view]] - you can use [[Github Desktop]] to sync the repository with a local folder - used as the vault on [[Obsidian]].

With GitHub Desktop, you can interact with GitHub using a GUI instead of the command line or a web browser. You can use GitHub Desktop to complete most Git commands from your desktop, such as pushing to, pulling from, and cloning remote repositories, attributing commits, and creating pull requests, with visual confirmation of changes.
