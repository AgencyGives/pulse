## [[How to contribute?]]

If you'd like to contribute to the knowledge base check out open tasks and issues to develop the content of a specific topic:
- [[Github]]: check open issues on github and open a pull request for your contribution
- [[Dework]]: use it to see open tasks or check them directly on github

Tasks and issues are opened only for specific topics to be developed. If you'd like to contribute in any other way please do so on the Github repo by opening pull requests and pushing changes to the main branch once complete.


## [[Infrastructure]]

Check out the linked pages to see how the integration works and its role in it and how to setup each piece:
1. [[Dework]] - tasks assignment
	- used by contributors to check and apply for tasks
2. [[Github]] - git-versioned storage and editing of repository
	- used by contributors to check and work on files and submit/push changes once it's complete
3. [[Github Desktop]] - sync mechanism between the repo and a local folder
	- used to integrate the repo as a vault on [[Obsidian]]
4. [[Obsidian]] - read/writing platform
	- used by contributors to access and edit (through [[Github Desktop]]) the knowledge base with support to links and the [[Graph view]]
5. [[Obsidian Publish]] - Obsidian publishing platform
	- used by anyone to check the open knowledge base with support to links and the [[Graph view]]
