My tactical idea is that the demand for these coins would increase as a symptom
of the anxiety that financial institutions can be made to feel about the future liquidity
of capital markets. The value (desirability) of the coin could here become symptom,
in the manner of a Lacanian “quilting point” that conflates signifier and signified in
a metonymic chain. Jacques Lacan, The Psychoses 1955– 1956, ed. Jacques-Alain Miller,
