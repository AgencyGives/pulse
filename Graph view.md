The graph view is a feature of [[Obsidian]] that allows people to visualize the interconnectedness between notes (files) of topics, ideas and concepts in a Knowledge Graph. Each note is a node in the graph, connected to each other according to their links.
With [[Obsidian Publish]] the knowledge graph is publicly accessible on the web.
