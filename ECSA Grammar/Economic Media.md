Economic media describes the convergence of financial, communicative, computational and organizational media. ECSA wants to undertake the redesign of ECONOMIC MEDIA collectively, cooperatively, consciously as a new form of literacy and political engagement. ECONOMIC MEDIA are (1) [[MONEY]] in all its forms including bullion, currency, credit/[[DEBT]], financial instruments, and equity (‘[[MONEY]]’, financial and synthetic financial instruments and property of all types with their differing degrees of convertibility), and (2) all other media (print, cinema, television, social media, computation). For more than a century these media, ‘financial’ on the one hand and ‘cultural’ on the other, have been convergent. Social media is already ECONOMIC MEDIA: it horizontalized our communication, but left the [[INFORMATION]] and [[PROTOCOL]] layer called the [[ECONOMY]] untouched: we can’t control the economic PROTOCOLs that underpin the [[VALUE]] capture of our communication. And for example “[[MONEY]]”, “[[DEBT]]”, “equity” are already social media, they express a certain kind of social relationality: the social relations [[CAPITALISM]] has claimed as the meaning of the word “[[ECONOMY]]”. Post-capitalist ECONOMIC MEDIA redesigns this convergence. We want to create a more expressive [[MEDIUM]] to describe our economic NETWORKs, their participants, the nature of their relations and how they change, what they [[VALUE]], how it is measured and exchanged. A post-capitalist ECONOMIC MEDIA which open and free to use, gives everyone equal capacities of [[ECONOMIC EXPRESSION]] and does not collapse into single universal [[VALUE]] definition of a fiat [[MONEY]] or one “master [[TOKEN]]” (e.g. BTC, ETH etc.) see [[Master Signifier]].
