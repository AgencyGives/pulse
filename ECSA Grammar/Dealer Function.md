[[ECSA Grammar]]

A [[MARKET]] needs to have two PRICEs. Dealer makes the [[MARKET]] by creating the inside [[SPREAD]], the [[SPREAD]] that appears as “the [[MARKET]]”.  The dealer collects the inside [[SPREAD]]. And crosses the outside [[SPREAD]]. The dealer model of providing [[LIQUIDITY]] is very different from the lender model.
