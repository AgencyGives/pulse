An ECONOMIC [[AGENT]] can issue and redeem [[TOKENs]]: it can keep track of its own and its counterparties ledgers. It records them as assets and liabilities (balance sheet approach), one [[AGENT]]’s asset is always another [[AGENT]]’s liability. Together they create a distributed data structure: the [[DISTRIBUTED LEDGER]]. Instead of a centralized state/ledger/[[OFFER]] queue each [[AGENT]] is holding only its own records and replication happens only at connection points i.e. only among the interested and involved parties, not among the entire [[NETWORK]]. This provides a [[NETWORK]] topology in which any arbitrary number nodes can fail but as long as there are other nodes present trades can still happen. Distributed state OFFERs a different kind of fault tolerance and scalability VS. brute force global state replication.
