A historical [[PROTOCOL]] and a social relation. An inferior mode of finance. In financial [[CAPITALISM]] the growth in the forms of inDEBTedness is the condition for capital accumulation, just like expansion of labor force participation, was for expanding commodity production. Our collective capacity to assume DEBT and pay taxes and be the direct bearer of austerity measures create direct vehicles for financial asset accumulation. The increasing supply of government bonds s possible only through deficit cuts and excluding all inflationary spending. This is like the financial equivalent of raw material for industrial production. In financial [[ECONOMY]] the surplus is extracted more directly from this collective capacity to become more inDEBTed and pay taxes than from the stagnating number of people employed in goods and services production.
