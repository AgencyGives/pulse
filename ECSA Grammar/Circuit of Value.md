[[ECSA Grammar]]

A CIRCUIT OF [[VALUE]] refers to the process where an [[ECONOMY]] goes through continuous processes of production, sale, consumption and investment leading to new production (hence a circuit). Expansion sees the [[VALUE]] of output grow as it moves round the circuit. Crisis is associated with a break in the circuit.
