A [[PROTOCOL]] for credit [[ISSUANCE]] and [[CLEARING]]: AGENTs issuing COLLATERALised credit enable [[TRANSACTIONS]] to be netted (cleared) on [[NETWORK]] ledgers. By issuing and OFFERing/accepting [[LIQUIDITY]] [[TOKENs]] [[SPACE]]-[[agent]]">Economic [[SPACE]] Agents gain the capability to enter the P2P credit and [[CLEARING]] [[NETWORK]]. Reciprocal [[ISSUANCE]] of [[LIQUIDITY]] [[TOKENs]] involves OFFERs of credit. When matched by an acceptance, credit is granted to enable the [[NETWORK]]’s ledger to be netted (balanced) efficiently, without a [[CLEARING]] house.
