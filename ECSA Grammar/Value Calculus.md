Social relations are majorly influenced by the ways in which [[VALUE]] is being determined. It is a well known fact that [[PRICE]] is as a form of coordination, with effects on every individual, every corporation and every government participating in fiat MARKETs. The ECSA stack allows a discourse to take place where Finance traditionally does not concede it. This discourse is automatically part of a mathematical [[procedure]], its results take place in the calculation of [[PRICE]]. These steadily updated forms of measurement allow [[VALUE]] to be distributed and  allow new definitions of “surplus” to emerge.
