Where do you go when you want to dissent from fiat, when you want to take a stand against fiat, the hierarchical social relations and destruction to the environment it represents? Where do you go when you want to bet against it (short it), when you think it is a cultural-financial asset in decline, and you want to find new STABILITY from a different set of economic and social relations? When fiat currencies face their next future crisis, we want to be talking already about what new stabilities — new social relations, processes and goals that we believe should be constant; new metrics of STABILITY — we are advocating. We think this is the real social potential of [[CRYPTOECONOMY]].
