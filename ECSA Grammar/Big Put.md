The means to put the risks of [[CAPITALISM]]â€™s fragility back onto the [[MARKET]]. Another name to the ECSA [[TOKEN]]. BIG PUT is a play both on the capitalist desire to short itself (it is wasteful, fragile & unstable: a cultural-financial asset in decline) and the [[SPREAD]] that will emerge between the [[Network|NETWORK ]]capacities of the existing capitalist economic [[NETWORK]] and the post-capitalist economic [[NETWORK]]: a [[SPREAD]] between their [[STABILITY]], accessibility, efficiency of distribution, adaptability, scalability, privacy, functional equality and programmability.
