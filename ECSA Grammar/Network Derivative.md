[[Tokens]] and assets are [[NETWORK]] DERIVATIVEs. As a concept, [[NETWORK]] [[DERIVATIVE]] expands [[TOKEN]] beyond just a “[[TOKEN]]”, to the metrics that are the underliers of the [[TOKEN]]. If [[NETWORK]] index ([[PERFORMANCE]] index) is a measure of an aspect of the [[PERFORMANCE]] of a [[NETWORK]], then the [[NETWORK]] [[DERIVATIVE]] represents a position on the index: it expresses a connection to the underlying vitality of each specific and purposeful [[NETWORK]]. [[Network]] [[DERIVATIVE]] is a [[RIGHT]] to an underlying – it carries always [[INFORMATION]] about the underlying process that creates it. [[NETWORK]] DERIVATIVEs are like a two way interface to massively distributed systems: through [[NETWORK]] DERIVATIVEs you can both sense into them and affect them. [[NETWORK]] indices and [[NETWORK]] DERIVATIVEs build from this [[INFORMATION]] will be the primary content discovery paradigm of the Economic Web where nodes are [[SPACE]]-[[agent]]">[[Economic SPACE]] Agents and [[TOKENs]] the links in the [[NETWORK]] – just like keyword based search was the dominant content discovery paradigm in Web 1.0 (where nodes were documents and hyperlinks the links in the [[NETWORK]]) and social based feed was for Web 2.0. (where nodes were people, brands and likes/follows the linking mechanism).
