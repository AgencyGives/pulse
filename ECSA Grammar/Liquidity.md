Liquidity is for us messaging capacity: being liquid means being able to message, to link, to issue & receive messages: it tells what kind of a membership/capacity one has in the [[NETWORK]]. What counts as LIQUIDITY and who decides this is one of the key questions defining [[CAPITALISM]] as a financial system. In [[CAPITALISM]] LIQUIDITY is governed by the state, the banking system it superintends, and the [[MONEY]] it endorses. When only those state-approved AGENTs can issue, then a [[LIQUIDITY PREMIUM]] (a rate of return on [[MONEY]]) can be charged for the risks involved in holding illiquid assets. [[POST-CAPITALISM]] challenges this hegemony as the source of [[MONEY]] [[ISSUANCE]], proposing instead p2p reciprocal [[ISSUANCE]] amongst AGENTs in a [[NETWORK]]. Where all AGENTs can issue, there need be no [[LIQUIDITY PREMIUM]]. This doesn’t make LIQUIDITY costless, but it can be backed by [[STAKE]] (risking-together) rather than the power of [[ISSUANCE]] and the transference of risk. [[STAKE]], or risking-together, becomes the ‘complement’ of LIQUIDITY, giving the notion of ownership a very different meaning from its application in [[CAPITALISM]].
