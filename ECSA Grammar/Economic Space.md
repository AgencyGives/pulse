**We think we are discovering a new [[VALUE]] form: a new social and relational form that characterizes the [[INFORMATION]] age, and the old [[ECONOMIC GRAMMAR]] does not express or understand. We call it the ECONOMIC [[SPACE]]. 

(1) ECONOMIC [[SPACE]] is an economic collaboration [[SPACE]] bounded by a [[PROTOCOL]].

(2) ECONOMIC [[SPACE]] is an [[EXPRESSION]], but can also become an expressor, i.e, an [[AGENT]] or [[AGENCY]]. Why is it important to see an economic interaction [[SPACE]] bounded by a [[PROTOCOL]] also as a synthetic [[AGENT]] rather than just a [[MARKET]]? This reflectivity means that a [[NETWORK]] can fold on itself, it can express itself as a living thing: that it can create its own subjectivity, talk and reason about itself and create its own (ECONOMIC [[SPACE]]) [[AGENCY]].  It means it can have an ethic, a relation to itself, to affect and be affected by itself.  We are moving from a mere endless “multitude” (Deleuze) to “severality” (Bracha Ettinger) or to a “fold”.

(3) ECONOMIC [[SPACE]] is an [[AGENT]] that is able to hold, issue, clear, credit, [[STAKE]] and trade. It is like a hybrid of a wallet, a ledger, a trader, a dealer, a STAKEholder, an organizer, a [[MARKET]] maker, a curator, a navigator. An ECONOMIC [[SPACE]] has its own ledger(s) and is able to send, receive and engage in financial relationships: to create relationships with other ECONOMIC SPACEs. [[NETWORK]] of OFFERs enables the creation of persistent patterns (“organization”) in these relations.

(4) ECONOMIC [[SPACE]] is also known as a [[SOCIAL DERIVATIVE]].**
