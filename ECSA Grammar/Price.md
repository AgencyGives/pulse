Price is a [[DERIVATIVE]] index on underlying [[INFORMATION]] that reduces complex [[INFORMATION]] into something simple. It is just one way to index [[INFORMATION]], and though it gets treated as the privileged index of valuation in [[CAPITALISM]], it is just a political and social construct, i.e., an [[EXPRESSION]]. We can design many different kinds of indices to help us navigate. PRICE does not capture [[INNOVATION]] very well. It runs only on one note. What if we could have a symphony?
