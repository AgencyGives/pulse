Metapragmatic [[GRAMMAR]] is the multi-[[AGENT]], real-time design and play ([[EXPRESSION]]) of [[PERFORMANCE]] scripts (aka SOCIAL DERIVATIVEs), participation in them and sharing in their outcomes. The metapragmatic nature of the ECSA economic-organizational [[GRAMMAR]] allows multiple players to script PERFORMANCEs (productive organizations) like interoperating narratives, with the kind of nuance, immediacy and reflective multi-[[AGENCY]] native to narratives.

Metapragmatic [[GRAMMAR]] OFFERs a more fundamental understanding of the communication situation VS. the contract model and the efficient [[MARKET]] model. METAPRAGMATIC [[GRAMMAR]] reveals [[MARKET]] as a [[PROTOCOL]] (and that [[PROTOCOL]] is not a [[MARKET]]): it is the [[GRAMMAR]] that links, not the [[MARKET]]. METAPRAGMATIC [[GRAMMAR]] redefines distributed system as a whole defined by the changing relationship of its parts, which does partitioning by indexing and does not have to choose between consistency and fork.
