[[Navigation]] in the new [[ECONOMIC SPACE]]. In a [[TOKEN]] [[ECONOMY]] context of transparency and decentralized open source data we need a reliable runtime and a [[GRAMMAR]] that can help us navigate and operate this [[SPACE]] and build knowledge DERIVATIVEs (indices) of it. Without these tools we are today without politics, economics, incapable of expressing and intervening in processes and future of our life. This is the technology development task we are taking on in ECSA. It is a new content discovery paradigm. Renaissance scientists, like Galileo Galilei and Leonardo da Vinci, invented the experiments and instruments to navigate, understand and measure the newly opened [[SPACE]]-time reality — the microscopes and telescopes to reveal micro- and macrocosms, inclinometers to determine latitudes, thermoscopes to show change of temperature, barometers to reveal atmospheric pressure, nautical instruments, experimental methods to understand invisible phenomena, velocity, acceleration, [[GRAVITY]] — we will need to do the same now for the new [[ECONOMIC SPACE]]-time. It is going to be a new renaissance See also [[NAVIGATION]], and Index.
