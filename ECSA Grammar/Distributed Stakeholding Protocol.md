A [[PROTOCOL]] for [[SPACE]]-[[agent]]">[[Economic SPACE]] Agents to create [[STAKEHOLDING]] relationships in each others’ [[VALUE]] productions and to COLLATERALize credit lines. By issuing and OFFERing/accepting [[STAKE]] [[TOKENs]] [[SPACE]]-[[agent]]">[[Economic SPACE]] Agents gain capability to enter the P2P [[STAKEHOLDING]] [[NETWORK]]. OFFERs of [[STAKE]] [[TOKENs]] are accepted, creating a [[STAKEHOLDING]] relationship, and a transfer of a specific ownership. [[STAKE]] serves as [[COLLATERAL]] for credit. The [[STAKEHOLDING]] [[NETWORK]] is like a subNETWORK created through the [[STAKE]] [[TOKENs]]: how a [[STAKE]] [[TOKEN]] relates to another [[STAKE]] [[TOKEN]] (the logic) is inside [[STAKE]] [[TOKENs]]. Putting on [[OFFER]] a [[STAKE]] [[TOKEN]] introduces the capacity to create another [[NETWORK]][[Stake| (a S]]TAKE holding [[NETWORK]]) into the DEX [[PROTOCOL]]. The capacity of P2P [[ISSUANCE]] of [[STAKE]] enables AGENTs to diversify (share) risks: to risk-together. Capacity to issue [[STAKE]] into a [[VALUE]] production opens up new fundraising forms.  Gives ECONOMIC AGENTs a capacity to create recognised [[COLLATERAL]] for credit [[ISSUANCE]]. In short, gives ECONOMIC AGENTs a capacity for wealth creation and accumulation around heterogeneous [[VALUE]] productions. Allows new forms of sharing risk & upside (new kind of relations) directly among peers, and allows [[SPACE]]-[[agent]]">[[Economic SPACE]] Agents to design these forms; you can organize/STAKEhold around VALUEs and NETWORKs that you [[VALUE]]. A key piece in the [[SPACE]]-[[protocol]]">[[Economic SPACE Protocol]] (ECSP).
