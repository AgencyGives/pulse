Social DERIVATIVEs  are the new basic economic cells of post-capitalist society: a new social and relational form – a form of risking and opening new opportunities together, and sharing its risks and upsides – that characterizes the [[INFORMATION]] age and which the old [[ECONOMIC GRAMMAR]] does not express or understand (it only talks “commodity”, “company” and “private ownership”). The ECSA [[PROTOCOL]] is designed for expressing such new social-economic forms. They are our strategies for surfing the [[VOLATILITY]] of our precarious world and the joy in working together. DERIVATIVEs are much more than mere self-executing contracts that reduce counterparty risk. They have a social logic that takes us beyond mere profit taking exchange and ownership as the form of sociality. The [[DERIVATIVE]] is a logic that allows us to understand how heterogenous parts move together, how to [[VALUE]] and sense the ways we are linked together, how [[VALUE]] is made in motion and of change, and what it means to risk-together. ECSA (like all ECONOMIC SPACEs) is a SOCIAL [[DERIVATIVE]], a risk generating practice  which ARBITRAGEs, speculates and leverages about being able to act together, on a certain gap or an opening or an opportunity. It makes our flows of STAKEs and risks intertwined in a way that articulates and expands the “inDEBTness” that we are making this together.
