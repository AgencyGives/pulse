Derivative means generally a financial exposure to movements of an index (predominantly but not exclusively [[PRICE]]), but without necessarily ownership of the underlier to which the index refers. They therefore [[PRICE]] risk, and enable all risks to be compared. DERIVATIVE contracts differ according to the sort of exposure attached to an index. Furthermore, we are moving from a definition of DERIVATIVE as a “self-executing contract that reduces counterparty risk” (Ethereum white paper) to understanding a DERIVATIVE as a relationship between co-text and context and a sensitivity to changes: we understand DERIVATIVEs as an ongoing ability to isolate co-text from context, to turn co-text into something useful for measuring. This is a very different sense of “smartness” in DERIVATIVEs. We think they have a social logic. See [[SOCIAL DERIVATIVE]].
