Stake is an ownership of a financial exposure to the contingencies of PERFORMANCEs. It frames contingency as economic potentiality: it is a financial position on a [[PERFORMANCE]] index. It captures the preparedness to invest in some ownership (a set of RIGHTs) of a [[PERFORMANCE]] [[DERIVATIVE]]. It creates a social relationship, through a set of RIGHTs, different to equity, but definitely invoking the skin in the game aspect. STAKEs are OFFERed to the [[MARKET]], with no knowledge of which [[AGENT]] (prepared to accept the [[OFFER]]) will end up the owner, and can circulate in a secondary [[MARKET]]. Buying STAKE in a [[PERFORMANCE]] is a way to signal the [[NETWORK]] what you want to make happen.
