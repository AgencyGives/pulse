[[Economic SPACE]] [[AGENT]] has the same capacities as an [[ECONOMIC AGENT]], but follows a set of PROTOCOLs that enable it to create relational [[VALUE]] forms, [[LIQUIDITY]], and risk-sharing through commodity ([[PERFORMANCE]]) [[TOKENs]], [[LIQUIDITY]] [[TOKENs]] and [[STAKE]] [[TOKENs]]. Via a distributed payments and settlement [[PROTOCOL]], they can issue and clear credit among each other by issuing [[LIQUIDITY]] [[TOKENs]], denominated in a shared [[UNIT OF ACCOUNT]] with a parity exchange agreement. Via a distributed risk sharing [[PROTOCOL]], AGENTs can issue [[STAKE]] in the output ([[PERFORMANCE]]) of an [[SPACE]]-[[agent]]">[[Economic SPACE]] [[Agent]]; it serves as a [[COLLATERAL]] for [[LIQUIDITY]] [[TOKENs]] and determines the size of the reciprocal credit line. Together these PROTOCOLs make a formal [[ECONOMIC GRAMMAR]]: a new economic [[LANGUAGE]] for expressing economic-organizational relations.
