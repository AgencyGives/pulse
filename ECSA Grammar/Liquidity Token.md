[[Liquidity]] [[TOKEN]] is a [[Network Derivative]]. It is the oil that lubricates the [[NETTING]] process, by temporarily  ‘standing in’ for different sorts of [[PERFORMANCE]] commodities or STAKEs in the facilitation of the [[NETTING]] process. In other words, [[LIQUIDITY]] [[TOKEN]] is the representation of credit; the mode in which the [[NETWORK]] records credit between one [[AGENT]] and another. As credit is general, unlike commodity and [[STAKE]] [[TOKENs]] that are specific to particular [[PERFORMANCE]] commodities and STAKEs, the [[LIQUIDITY]] [[TOKEN]] is the universal [[TOKEN]] in the [[NETWORK]] denominated in the [[UNIT OF ACCOUNT]]. It must be redeemed on demand for any [[TOKEN]] on [[OFFER]] by an [[ECONOMIC AGENT]].
