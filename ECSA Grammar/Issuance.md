Issuance means the creation of new [[MONEY]], securities (stocks, bonds, notes, debentures, bills, DERIVATIVEs) or [[TOKENs]]. In the legacy financial system, ISSUANCE is undertaken by banks in the case of [[MONEY]], and other legal entities in the case of securities (corporations, TRUSTs, governments). The [[distributed exchange PROTOCOL]] says that any [[ECONOMIC AGENT]] can be an issuer, so long as the [[NETWORK]] TRUSTs the ISSUANCE.
