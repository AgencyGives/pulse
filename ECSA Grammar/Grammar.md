A GRAMMAR is a coordinating tool, a co-referencing tool, that doesn’t require a global clock. A [[LANGUAGE]] operates differently: it has no synchronization, but with validation by indexing, by embedding temporalities to one another through indexing. A GRAMMAR makes possible the telling of multiple stories at the same time: coordinating the time of speech events, not through one utterance, but through unfolding of the many conversations as they are calibrated against each other: a GRAMMAR coordinates any potential conversation with another with no central time. How does this relate to the [[ECONOMY]]? The [[ECONOMY]] cannot really be mapped to or by the calendar time – calendar time does not have the play of creativity of indexicality, creativity of each utterance being coordinated (co-referenced) with one another.
