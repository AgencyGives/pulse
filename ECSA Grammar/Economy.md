The ECONOMY is a [[NETWORK]]: a group of AGENTs interacting under certain agreements, i.e. PROTOCOLs, that define the relations that form the [[NETWORK]], their state and how these may change. Starting with NETWORKs situates AGENTs in a social context and gives focus to their collective endeavour as ontologically prior to their individual interactions. Revealing the ECONOMY as a [[NETWORK]] means that the [[PROTOCOL]] that unites its AGENTs does not need to be taken for granted, but can be redesigned. Framed this way, the ECONOMY is programmable: how the ECONOMY works and what are its key conventions – under what kind of relations, interactions, AGENTs, VALUEs, state changes the [[NETWORK]] operates – can become a design [[SPACE]], continuously open to its participating AGENTs.
