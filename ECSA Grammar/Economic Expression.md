We’ve realized that we are creating a [[LANGUAGE]] for new ECONOMIC [[EXPRESSION]]. It is an economic [[LANGUAGE]] that can express capitalist [[NETWORK]] PROTOCOLs, but even more, it can go beyond them. It can encompass capitalist [[VALUE CALCULUS]], but express more qualified VALUEs and refuse their collapse into the monological [[VALUE]]-[[EXPRESSION]] that disqualifies non-[[MONEY]] VALUEs as economic externalities. It is capable of valuing the biosphere, care, intangibles and social [[INNOVATION]] — without reducing their [[INFORMATION]] into one index of [[PRICE]] and one measuring unit of profitability. It is a post-capitalist [[LANGUAGE]] (a [[LANGUAGE]] for post-capitalist ECONOMIC [[EXPRESSION]]), in a literal sense. A new [[ECONOMIC GRAMMAR]] for the [[INFORMATION]] age. The place where this post-capitalist economic [[NETWORK]] [[LANGUAGE]] is spoken and understood is the new [[ECONOMIC SPACE]]. It is a place of [[VALUE]] creation where qualified VALUEs — at once in excess of and more granular than that of USD or BTC — can both be expressed, composed and rendered interoperable. It multiplies denominations, which remain interoperable, because they share the same [[GRAMMAR]].
