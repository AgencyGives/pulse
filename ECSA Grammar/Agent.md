[[ECSA Grammar]]

[[Economic SPACE]] AGENT is a first [[class]] citizen in the new [[ECONOMIC SPACE]]: has a private [[SPACE]], is able to issue and hold RIGHTs, to accept and receive OFFERs and it has an internal ordered event timeline (own “blockchain”). All AGENTs can be issuers and clearers, engage in creation of credit, [[COLLATERAL]], [[STAKE]] and other financial relationships. Peering together through a shared [[PROTOCOL]] – a shared [[ECONOMIC GRAMMAR]] – AGENTs form a NETWORKed economic system with privacy preserving, scalable architecture, with no central data broker, host or owner.
