Fundamental [[VALUE]] refers to the idea that there exists an underlying [[VALUE]] of outputs which is discrete from [[PRICE]]. In some versions, FUNDAMENTAL [[VALUE]] approximates long-term [[PRICE]] (i.e. ignoring short-term [[VOLATILITY]]); in other versions FUNDAMENTAL [[VALUE]] is determined by forces other than supply and demand. For Marx, this determinant of output [[VALUE]] is socially necessary labour time. In the new [[ECONOMIC SPACE]] it is [[Performance]]s.
