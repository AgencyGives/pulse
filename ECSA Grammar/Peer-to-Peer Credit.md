Peer-to-peer credit is one of the forms that [[SELF-ISSUANCE]] may take. [[TOKEN]] [[ISSUANCE]] starts with an [[OFFER]] and is realized on acceptance of the [[OFFER]]. Users exchange [[TOKENs]] grafted to their ECONOMIC SPACEs in effect issuing each other credit in an act of mutual [[TRUST]]. This provides users with [[LIQUIDITY]]. Rather than paying interest for [[LIQUIDITY]] as one does with tradition credit in capitalist sytems, here one OFFERs and recieves [[TRUST]] on a [[PEER TO PEER]] basis. This economic dyad becomes the basic building block of the social and economic fabric of the ECSA platform.
