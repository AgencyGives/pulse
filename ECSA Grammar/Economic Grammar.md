Bitcoin identified the TRUSTed intermediary component of [[CAPITALISM]] – [[CAPITALISM]] is a regime of verification which depends on faith, which depends on violence and coercion – and saw that there can be more freedom. It thus unleashed the question of the _sociality_of [[VALUE]] ([[VALUE]] is always social-institutional), but didn’t give a [[LANGUAGE]] to express it. Ethereum opened our imagination for possibilities of such [[LANGUAGE]]. ECSA ECONOMIC [[GRAMMAR]] actually gives us that [[LANGUAGE]]: with it you can express new [[VALUE]] forms and the sociality and organizationality of [[VALUE]] (aka “composite AGENTs”, and “[[VALUE]] NETWORKs”, “social interaction SPACEs bounded by PROTOCOLs”). See also SOCIAL DERIVATIVEs.
