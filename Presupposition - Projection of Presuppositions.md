**Projection of Presuppositions**

A presupposition of a part of an utterance is sometimes also a presupposition of the whole utterance, and sometimes not. For instance, the phrase _my wife_ triggers the presupposition that I have a wife. The first sentence below carries that presupposition, even though the phrase occurs inside an embedded clause. In the second sentence, however, it does not. John might be mistaken about his belief that I have a wife, or he might be deliberately trying to misinform his audience, and this has an effect on the meaning of the second sentence, but, perhaps surprisingly, not on the first one.

1.  John thinks that **my wife** is beautiful.
2.  John said that **my wife** is beautiful.

Thus, this seems to be a property of the main verbs of the sentences, _think_ and _say_, respectively. After work by Lauri Karttunen, verbs that allow presuppositions to "pass up" to the whole sentence ("project") are called **holes**, and verbs that block such passing up, or _projection_ of presuppositions are called **plugs**. Some linguistic environments are intermediate between plugs and holes: They block some presuppositions and allow others to project. These are called **filters**. An example of such an environment are indicative conditionals ("If-then" clauses). A conditional sentence contains an _antecedent_ and a _consequent_. The antecedent is the part preceded by the word "if," and the consequent is the part that is (or could be) preceded by "then." If the consequent contains a presupposition trigger, and the triggered presupposition is explicitly stated in the antecedent of the conditional, then the presupposition is blocked. Otherwise, it is allowed to project up to the entire conditional. Here is an example:

If **I have a wife**, then **my wife** is blonde.

Here, the presupposition triggered by the expression _my wife_ (that I have a wife) is blocked, because it is stated in the antecedent of the conditional: That sentence doesn't imply that I have a wife. In the following example, it is not stated in the antecedent, so it is allowed to project, i.e. the sentence _does_ imply that I have a wife.

If it's already 4am, then **my wife** is probably angry.

Hence, conditional sentences act as _filters_ for presuppositions that are triggered by expressions in their consequent.

A significant amount of current work in semantics and pragmatics is devoted to a proper understanding of when and how presuppositions project.
