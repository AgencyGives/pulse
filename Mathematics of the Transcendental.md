Kant's transcendental is not transcendent. It is not beyond experience. It is in experience as the ground of possibility of experience. Badiou's transcendental is in a situation and "serves as a domain for the evaluation of identities and differences" in that situation (p. 167).

// a transcendental is the salient context

Insofar as mathematical ontology takes a situation to be a categorical universe, **a transcendental is what mathematicians call a poset of truth values**, in the sense of global elements of a truth value object.

// when we create an Order for salience

In Part One Badiou calls truth value objects central objects. Mathematicians also use the term **_subobject classifier_** or sometimes _Lawvere-Tierney object_ for the creators of the idea. **This object is "central" to connecting movements inside a universe with its internal logic or in Badiou's terms linking ontology to logic.**
